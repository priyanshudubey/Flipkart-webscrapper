# Flipkart-webscrapper

This is a very small web scrapper code written in `Python3` with the help of ButifulSoup. <br />
This code will give you the following thing:
- Mobile Name
- Mobile Price
- Mobile feature

You can scrap many things just by putting there `css class` <br />
> These data are scrapped from *Flipkart* <br />
